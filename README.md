## Game Concept

**Oregon Fail** is a parody of the classic Oregon Trail game, but with a modern twist. You and your ragtag crew tried the "off-grid dream" out west (Portland, San Francisco, or Los Angeles) but quickly realized that Wi-Fi is spotty and rent is still $2,000 for a yurt. Now, you're making the journey back to civilization (New York or Chicago) in your creaky VW bus.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Enter your name, choose your starting point and destination, and name your crew members.
2. **Resources**: Manage your gas, cash, and snacks throughout the journey.
3. **Actions**:
   - **Travel**: Move forward on your journey (consumes gas and snacks)
   - **Rest**: Recover crew health (costs cash and snacks)
   - **Shop**: Buy supplies or earn money through odd jobs
   - **Check Crew**: Check on your crew members' status

## Game Features

- **Random Events**: Encounter various situations on the road, from flat tires to viral TikTok opportunities
- **Modern Challenges**: Deal with uniquely contemporary problems like Tesla pileups, climate change flash floods, and digital withdrawal in dead zones
- **Crew Management**: Keep your crew healthy and happy, or they might leave you
- **Resource Management**: Balance your limited resources to make it across the country
- **Multiple Endings**: Reach your destination successfully, run out of gas, or lose all your crew members
- **Retro Graphics**: 8-bit/16-bit style green-on-black graphics reminiscent of Game Boy games

## Modern Challenges

The game features several contemporary challenges that put a humorous spin on modern life:

- **Roadblocks**: "Highway closed for a Tesla pileup. Wait 3 days or detour through a MAGA rally?"
- **Climate Change**: "Flash flood from climate change. Bus is leaking—lose snacks to mold."
- **Shady Encounters**: "Mechanic offers a tune-up for $50 or your last kale chips. Trust him?"
- **Internet Issues**: "No signal in Idaho. Your crew member livestreams anyway—battery drops 20%."

## Graphics Style

The game features a nostalgic 8-bit/16-bit green-on-black visual style:

- **Monochrome Theme**: Green pixels on a black backdrop, reminiscent of classic Game Boy games
- **VW Bus**: A pixelated van that wobbles when breakdowns occur
- **Character Sprites**: Simple pixel characters with unique visual traits based on their status
- **Dynamic Landscapes**: The background changes as you progress from the mountainous West Coast through the flat Midwest to the cityscape of your destination
- **Resource UI**: Minimalist green bars and text showing your current resources

## Game Mechanics

- Each day of travel consumes resources
- Random events can help or hinder your progress
- Crew members can get sick, leave, or go viral on social media
- The journey ends when you either reach your destination or run out of essential resources
